Version    Date          Notes
------------------------------------
1.20       Jan 16, 1999  Improved the trimming for very stretched grids, to make sure 
                         that near neighbors are not removed, so that the mismatch 
                         correction will work properly. Also changed the treatment
                         of boundaries in the hyperbolic grid generator to be the same
                         as in version 1.19. Furthermore, I have worked on the start
                         script to have the same script for both the OpenGL and Mesa
                         graphics.

1.19a      Dec  9, 1998  The installation procedure has been re-worked completely and an
                         installation script has been added that makes all the hardware-
                         specific changes in the makefiles. Pre-compiled binaries have 
                         also been added for a number of common hardwares.

1.19       Nov 21, 1998  Improved the surface hole-cutting algorithm by introducing
                         the normals of the test point associated with the edge
                         curves. The edge curve can only make a hole in a surface
                         grid when the normal of the test point is close to that of
                         the surface grid.

1.18        Oct 4, 1998  Improved the ray-tracing algorithm to make it aware of when
                         the intersection count is likely to be incorrect, i.e., when
                         the intersection between the ray and the surface is close to
                         beeing tangential. In this case, the direction of the ray is
                         changed until a confident count is achieved.

1.17      Sept 17, 1998  Introduced the grid lengthscale in the stopping criterion for 
                         Newton's iteration. This makes it possible to make overlapping
                         grids from very large (or small) component grids. Also fixed 
                         a bug in the rotation and translation of component grids.

1.16      Sept 15, 1998  Worked some more on the normalized coordinates, which makes
                         it possible to view objects with very different length scales
                         in the different coordinate directions.

1.15       Jul 16, 1998  Improved the surface hole-cutting algorithm to better handle
                         very thin bodies.

1.14       Jul 2, 1998   Fixed two annoying bugs. The first bug overwrote the surface
                         tolerances for the hole-cutting. The second bug, which only 
                         caused trouble on Linux systems, made the command interpreter 
                         crash.

1.13       May 22, 1998  Multiple rotations will now accumulate to make it easier to 
                         setup complicated transformations. A primitive mechanism for 
                         using normalized coordinates has also been added. Normalized 
                         (scaled) coordinates will make it easier to view objects that 
                         have a significantly different length scale in the different 
                         coordinate directions.

1.12       Mar 27, 1998  Improved the criterion for divergence in the newton iteration
                         for the inversion of mappings. The previous criterion caused
                         the code to crash in extreme cases (on the DEC-alpha). Also 
                         worked on the color table flickering problem that occured on
                         DEC-alpha stations without advanced graphics hardware. This 
                         problem is avoided in this version if the mesa graphics library
                         is used.

1.11       Mar 24, 1998  Changed the hole-cutting algorithm to work with an overlapping
                         surface grid instead of a hybrid grid. 
                         Increased the order of interpolation to cubic for the discrete
                         point surface mapping.
                         Introduced rotation, pre- and post-translation for mappings.
                         Added coordinates of the corners of the bounding box in the
                         plot window.

1.10       Feb 15, 1998  Added mismatch correction for interpolation points near 
                         physical boundaries. This is necessary to get boundary layer 
                         profiles in highly stretched grids correct.

1.09       Jan 27, 1998  Improved the construction of the hybrid surface grid
                         to better handle thin bodies. (The hybrid surface grid is used
                         during the hole-cutting to represent the boundary of the
                         computational domain.)

1.08       Jan 10, 1998  The search path for the tutorial command-files is now hard coded
                         during compile time to make the tutorials work regardless of the
                         directory the program is run from. The plotting has also been 
                         improved to handle very large or very small grids.
